The main idea behind this project is to implement real time engineering models  and architecture in a  virtual environment.
Propagate the famous building models with the help of revit and invoke that to unity.
From unity, work to be done on the additional virtual environmental feature on it.
Use leap motion features to create an additional information of the building model i.e. their material and their measurements too.
Generate a application to Android sdk to work it on the head mounted device.
Create a user study of how the student get use to this method to understand the architectural model  rather than seeing the blueprints or maps of it.
